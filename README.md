This was made by minesraft2, I got them because some person posted a link to wayback machine on minesraft's website, so I just copied it.

### Tutorial
Go into the hacks file, click the copy thing next to the trash can, go on Blooket, go into the console (ctrl + shift +J) and paste the code.
Just ignore the alert that says the hacks are outdated and press "Ok".
