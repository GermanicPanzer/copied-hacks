# not made by me
This was made by Minesraft2, who I think got banned. I got them because some person posted a link to wayback machine on Minesraft's website, so I just copied the GUI code.
The link to the website: https://web.archive.org/web/20230317142811/https://minesraft2.github.io/Blooket-Cheats/

### Tutorial
Go into the hacks file, click the copy thing next to the trash can, go on Blooket, go into the console (ctrl + shift +J) and paste the code.
Just ignore the alert that says the hacks are outdated and press "Ok".
